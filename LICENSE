Licenses
--------

The Joshfire Framework is dual licensed under the GPLv2 and a commercial license.

 - GPLv2
      
      A copy of this license is available in the gpl-2.0.txt file.

 - Commercial license

      The commercial license is inspired by the MIT license. It allows developers to
      distribute apps using the framework without having to include a copy of the code,
      as long as they distribute this license and the name of the authors along with their app.
      
      This license is granted to you for FREE, except when you want to:
        - Distribute your app pre-packaged with a physical electronic device
        - Bundle the framework in any way in a physical electronic device.
        
      These uses apply mostly to OEMs. Please contact us in this case.
